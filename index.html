                My name is Yoshikage Kira. I'm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh , where all
                the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get
                home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and
                make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about
                twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just
                like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at
                my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take
                care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep
                at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I
                were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.

                Stop calling me furry. Listen, I did my research. And I can safely say that I am NOT a furry. I do not
                condone any furry activity and would you believe it? I laugh at some furries. YES, furries are cringe,
                yes! I might say owo and uwu sometimes, but that's because IT'S CUTE and I don't care that it's
                considered furry. YES I JACK OFF TO YIFF AND THAT DOESN'T MAKE ME A FURRY. People in fursuits look very
                huggable, but I am NOT a furry! I am not writing this because I'm afraid that I actually might be a
                furry or am afraid people will bully me! It's because FURRIES ARE CRINGE!1! In conclusion: I am NOT a
                furry. Thank you for coming to my Ted talk.
                Guys, seriously. I really didn't want to have to make an announcement like this but yknow, I guess
                people still found it funny. Can you all seriously stop with saying “FURRY” and every single god damn
                chance you get? Honestly its so annoying and its not even funny. If someone's a furry just leave them
                alone? They're not harming you or making fun of you so please like stfu about it? Also like it bothers a
                lot of people when you comment furry EVERY SINGLE TIME THERES A MENTION OF AN ANIMAL. Dude, YOU CAN LIKE
                ANIMALS AN NOT BE A FURRY. It is so annoying and it's gotten out of hand, if you continue to say furry
                at everything that involves an animal we’re gonna have problems.

                Hey, did you know that in terms of male human and female Pokémon breeding, Vaporeon is the most
                compatible Pokémon for humans? Not only are they in the field egg group, which is mostly comprised of
                mammals, Vaporeon are an average of 3"03' tall and 63.9 pounds. this means they're large enough to be
                able to handle human dicks, and with their impressive Base stats for HP and access to Acid Armor, you
                can be rough with one. Due to their mostly water based biology, there's no doubt in my mind that an
                aroused Vaporeon would be incredibly wet, so wet that you could easily have sex with one for hours
                without getting sore. They can also learn the moves Attract, Baby-Doll eyes, Captivate, Charm and Tail
                Whip along with not having fur to hide nipples, so it'd be incredibly easy for one to get you in the
                mood. With their abilities Water Absorb and Hydration, they can easily recover from fatigue with enough
                water. No other Pokémon comes close with this level of compatibility. Also, fun fact, if you pull out
                enough, you can make your Vaporeon turn white. Vaporeon is literally built for human dick. Ungodly
                defense stat + high HP pool + Acid Armor means it can take cock all day, all shapes and sizes and still
                come for more.

                Yesterday, there was a Magic the Gathering tournament at my local hobby shop. My girlfriend decided to
                tag along and come support me. I ended up doing pretty poorly (1-3), but the hobby shop gave out a
                consolation prize of a random foiled uncommon card. The card that I received was called "Thought
                Erasure" and immediately held the card up to my girlfriend and said "AND I CAST THOUGHT ERASURE, BE GONE
                THOT!" as a joke, but said it pretty loudly. The shop is pretty small and a lot of people caught wind of
                my act and needless to say my girlfriend was very embarrassed. We're home now and she still hasn't
                spoken to me. I'm fucked boys.

                What the fuck. I’m 7 hours late. God, I’m so sorry Arashi… I— I can’t believe this. I’m in utter shock.
                How could I miss this occasion? I don’t know what to do. I can’t believe I slept through this. I vow to
                never sleep again. I am deeply sorry Arashi. I cannot believe I missed this. It’s my fault, all my
                fault. You looked so stunning, so beautiful. You ARE the main character my love. You are. No one else
                matters, not a single soul. Out of billions of people on earth, Arashi, you shine the brightest. You are
                the sun, my sun. You are bright, lovely, stunning, and most importantly, confident. You are the
                embodiment of grace, and love. You make me want to wake up every morning. You are amazing. Dare I say,
                you are, Ravely? Hahaha. I jest, that was simply a reference to one Aira Shiratori. Although I sure do
                feel like Aira right now, being that, I am truly fangirling over you at the moment. Haha. Any plans for
                tonight? I may be late, but never late enough for us not to have dinner, correct? Haha, farewell my
                love. I would write you so much more but I fear I am very ill. I fear I have caught COVID. It’s ok, I
                will recover. When I’m better we may dance together, for now… we must contain our love within 6 feet of
                each other.

                I’ve been banned for ten minutes and that was the right amount of time to think about what I had done to
                deserve this. I will not copy any pasta anymore. That was really a bad thing to do. My apologies to the
                chat,
            </p>
